# Creating Administrator Account

When you access Axibase Collector for the first time, Collector prompts you to configure a built-in administrator account.

Set up this account as part of the installation process:

1. Open Axibase Collector web interface at `https://hostname:9443`.
2. Enter username and password for the administrator account.
3. Click **Save**.
4. Log in to Axibase Collector again as an administrator.
